# Non-personalized Recommendations

Ranking and apriori method to Adjust dataset.

urvey network data consist of asking individuals whether they talked to or consulted anyone about some topic (name generator).

## Question format:

- If you ask people to recall names (an open list format), fatigue will result in underreporting

- If you ask people to check off names from a full list, you can often get over reporting

-   It is common to limit people to ~5 nominations. This will bias network stats for stars, but is  
  sometimes the best choice to avoid fatigue.

- Concrete relational indicators are best (who did you talk to?) over attitudes that are harder to  
define (who do you like?).
